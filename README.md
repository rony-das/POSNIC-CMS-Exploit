POSNIC CMS 1.03 Exploit.

On 03-02-2017 Manish Kishan Tanwar Bhaiyaji founded a Remote Code Execution in there. So i tried looking at source codes of the CMS and a file took my attention, checked the file carefully. There's a mechanism they are updating their "Logo's", and if a file with the name get's updated they delete the previous file & replaces with the new file. This thing is working because they are not passing these mechanism through any sessions associated with the admin logins.
Thanks.
